# Zuber_Rides_Analysis

This project utilizes data from Zuber, a new ride share company launching in Chicago, who is interested in understanding the market in their area. The analysis is based on three datasets: 1) 64 ride share companies' and their total number of trips, 2) 94 neighborhoods and their average number of trips, and 3) 1068 ride share trips' start time, weather, and duration. The data were initially retrieved from the web and a large database using HTML Parsing and SQL queries, respectively, downloaded into csvs, and then uploaded into Python for analysis. The project contains 3 parts: 

1. Import HTML parsed and SQL queried csv files into python
2. Exporatory data analysis and data visualizations
3. Two-Sample Hypothesis Tests
4. Conclusion and business application
