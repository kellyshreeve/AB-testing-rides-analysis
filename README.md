# Zuber Rides Analysis

# Project Overview

This project is based on data from Zuber, a new ride share company launching in Chicago. The company is new to the market and needs to understand customer behvior in the area. The analysis describes the local market using exploratory data analysis and visualizations and tests whether there is a significant difference in trip length during bad weather.

# Data

## Source Data

The analysis is based on three datasets: 
  1. Local ride share companies and their total number of trips (n=64)
  2. Local neighborhoods and their average number of drop offs (n=94)
  3. Ride share trips with start time, weather, and duration (n=1068)

## Data Acquisition

The data were retrieved through HTML parsing a web page and SQL queries of a large database. They were then downloaded into csvs, and then uploaded into Python for analysis. 

## Data Preprocessing

Data were checked for missing values and duplicates. None were found and no imputation was necessary.
 
# Code Structure
