The data were retrieved through HTML parsing a web page and SQL queries of a large database. They were then downloaded into csvs, and then uploaded into Python for analysis. 

## Code Structure

1. Import HTML parsed and SQL queried csv files into python
2. Exporatory data analysis and data visualizations
3. Two-Sample Hypothesis Tests
4. Conclusion and business application
